I'm a graduate of *Programming and Data Analysis* from LaSalle College in Montreal, and I'm passionate about everything tech. I love building things from scratch, solving problems with code, and working with data.

I have experience in web development, graphic design, and database management. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and put my skills into action.

In my free time, I enjoy **playing and developing video games**, watching **horror movies** 🎃, and reading **fantasy books** 🐉. I'm also currently working on improving my French 🇫🇷.
